# DriftSlackNotifier
A small Firebase Cloud Function to notify my slack team of new incoming messages on our Drift chat

### Installation
All you have to do is add your [Slack webhook url](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) to index.js:7
and upload to a host (Firebase Cloud functions for example). Whereafter you have to add the host url to your [Drift webhook](https://dev.drift.com)
